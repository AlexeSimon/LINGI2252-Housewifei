MAIN : Simulation will run for 15 seconds. First 3 seconds are for start-up time, with remote control deactivated. Next 7 seconds are fully simulated with remote control activated. Final 5 seconds are fully simulated with remote control deactivated. Simulation starts at night, human out of home and remote control set to OFF. Lights are to be turned on only if human is home and it is night and remote control is activated.
